# flask-base

Base code for any python flask web apps. Expect it to be constantly evolving and have a lot of sample code.

## Notes

I made this repo to reuse over and over again in my other web apps. It is opinionated and uses ideas from multiple sources; my favorite is currently [explore flask](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/index.html).
